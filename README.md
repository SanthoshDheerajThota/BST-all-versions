## BST(Binary Search Tree)

This is a program written by me to implement BST class with all the tree operations as member functions so as to implement them ouside the class using procedural abstraction(to make it easy to update if necessary)

## Member functions 
    1)insert(int data)
    2)printLevel(int level)
    3)print()

##  Member Functions description

    1)The funtion insert is used to insert the data in the Binary Search Tree
      this makes sure that the data is placed in the right place in the BST so
      as to make sure that searching takes time O(h) where h is the height of 
      the BST
    2)The function printLevel is used to print the level given as input.It is 
      even made to handle the corner cases so as to work efficiently
